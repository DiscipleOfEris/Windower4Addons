# EraInfoBar
FFXI Windower addon that displays a configurable bar showing information on your targets. Modified from Kenshi's
original addon for compatibility and more accuracy on Era.


## Installation
After downloading, extract to your Windower addons folder. Make sure the folder is called EraInfoBar, rather than
-master or -v1.whatever. Your file structure should look like this:

    addons/EraInfoBar/EraInfoBar.lua
    addons/EraInfoBar/mob.lua
    addons/EraInfoBar/mob_info.db
    addons/EraInfoBar/statics.lua

Once the addon is in your Windower addons folder, it won't show up in the Windower launcher. You need to load it
manually or add a line to your `scripts/init.txt`:

    lua load EraInfoBar


## Usage

### Adding variables
To add variables, run the addon once (which will create the file), then open the `addons/EraInfoBar/data/settings.xml`
file with a text editor. Edit the text inside tags such as `<NoTarget>text</NoTarget>` (when you have no target or
target yourself), `<TargetPC>text</TargetPC>` (you target another player), `<TargetNPC>text</TargetNPC>` (you target a
npc), and `<TargetMob>text</TargetMob>` (you target a mob). You can also add normal strings to them. Here's an example:
`<TargetMob>Name: ${name}, Family: ${ecosystem}</TargetMob>`. You can show specific text if a flag is true, such as:
`${aggressive|| Will attack you}` which will only display `Will attack you` if the mob is aggressive.
